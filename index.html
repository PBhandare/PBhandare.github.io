					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p class = "p">I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I previously attended Cambridge High School in Georgia.&nbsp;</p>
					<p class = "p">On the professional side of things, I enjoy applications of Math and some Computer Science/Data Science/Machine Learning. I enjoy exploring and interpretting data from various domains like energy, user data, or video games. I am particularly interested in exploring deep learning, techniques for extrapolating and gaining insights from data, and for the efficiency of the executing of the above.</p>
					<p class = "p">On the personal leisurely side of things, I enjoy bodybuilding, powerlifting, armwrestling, swimming, cycling, running, cooking, trying out exorbitantly spicy or unusual food, and video games.</p>
					<p class = "p">I am originally from India, and have lived in Cyprus during most of my early years before moving back to India, and finally moving to the United States. I like the warmth of the South, but I think I am preferring Wisconsin's frigid embrace more.</p>
